To build it, use:
`npm install`
`npm start`

There is no server included. You have for instance the following options:

- To serve the files run in the main directory:
    `npm install -g http-server`
    `http-server`
- Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in main directory if you have python installed.
- Copy index.html and bin/app.js to whatever server served directory
- Just open index.html in any browser.
